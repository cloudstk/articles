Lock Azure resources to prevent unexpected changes
=================================================
Locks allow us to control access to our subscription, resource group or individual resource. The lock
will helps to prevent from accidental deletion or modification of resources.

There are two types of resource locks that can be applied:
----------------------------------------------------------
* CanNotDelete - The resource can be read and modified, but not deleted the resource.
* ReadOnly - The resource can Read but not modify, delete or update the resource.

Locks can be assigned by using one of the following:
* Azure Portal
* PowerShell
* Azure CLI
* Template
* Rest API
